<p>At some point during the afternoon, the sky forgot what 
    color it wanted to be. 
    It shifted between pale blue and dull gray, 
    as if rehearsing for a storm that never arrived. 
    People kept walking faster anyway, carrying umbrellas that stayed 
    closed, driven more by habit than weather. 
    Somewhere between that hesitation and movement, the day quietly 
    passed without
     making any strong impression.</p>


     <p>He liked solving problems that didn’t ask for answers right away.
         The kind that sat in the back of the mind while he drank tea or stared
          out
          of windows.
          Most people called it overthinking, but to him it felt like 
          tuning an 
          instrument—slow adjustments until clarity appeared. 
        Not everything needed urgency; some things needed space.</p>

        <p>The notebook was filled with half-finished ideas, 
            crossed-out sentences, and arrows pointing nowhere. 
            It looked messy, almost careless, but it was honest. 
            Every page captured a moment of curiosity before discipline 
            stepped in. In a strange way, the chaos was proof that
             something was being built, 
            even if it didn’t yet have a shape.</p>
