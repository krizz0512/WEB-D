<h1>William Blake</h1> <br />
28 Broad Street</br />
 Carnaby Market,</br />
  London,England </br />
  <hr />
  <p>The soul walks naked through the fire of its own desire and </br />
calls the burning truth a sin only because the world fears light.</br />
I saw angels bound by laws they did not write and men crowned kings </br />
though blind to eternity. Where reason builds its cold and narrow </br />
        walls, imagination breaks them with a whisper</p>

        <p>Energy moves through all living things,</br />
    unseen yet undeniable, while restraint is merely the shadow </br />
              cast by fear. Those who deny desire deny life itself,</br />
             mistaking obedience for virtue and silence for peace. </br />
               The mind that dares to wander beyond limits finds heaven 
               not above, but within.</p>
